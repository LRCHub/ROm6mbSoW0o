It's a cold and heartless world
But behind the darkness
Shines a ray of hope
A line that twists and turns
Still you need to know
Which side you're standing on
To catch you when you fall
As we hang on the wire
We're puppets on a string
Some saints, some sinners
Dragged through the fire
Better decide who you are
In a world of saints and sinners
Now you're tied and can't break free
You've been taking on water
Surprise you're in too deep
Angels hide, won't seek
But the demons find you
As they never sleep
To catch you when you fall
As we hang on the wire
We're puppets on a string
Some saints, some sinners
Dragged through the fire
Better decide who you are
In a world of saints and sinners
As we hang on the wire
We're puppets on a string
Some saints, some sinners
Dragged through the fire
Better decide who you are
In a world of saints and sinners
