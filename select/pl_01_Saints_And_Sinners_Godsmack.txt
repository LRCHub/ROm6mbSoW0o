Yeah!
Grown from a seed of hope I've never known
Been raised by the surroundings of a home so
cold, so cold
If I only knew what I know
I'll shake my fist up to the sky
Just keeping my dreams alive
I'm one part saint and two part sinner,
And the last part is still on the line
We pray even when we know nobody cares, ah ya
And make everything we know turn into fear
And then disappear
If I only knew what I know
I'll shake my fist up to the sky
Just keeping my dreams alive
I'm one part saint and two part sinner,
And the last part is still on the line
I'll shake my fist up to the sky
Just keeping my dreams alive
I'm one part saint and two part sinner,
And the last part is still on the line
Ya, ya, ya,
Eye for an eye they told me for some time
No way to hide from what's inside, what's inside
of me!
I'll shake my fist up to the sky
Just keeping my dreams alive
I'm one part saint and two part sinner,
And the last part is still on the line
I'll shake my fist up to the sky
Just keeping my dreams alive
I'm one part saint and two part sinner,
And the last part is still on the line
